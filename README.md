TLM Monthly Projects by *thelearningmachine.ai*. Join our Slack to work on them together! -> https://forms.gle/uwYz5Qj6e5b4ydXV6

## Levels Overview
Projects are divided into 3 levels representing difficulty.
- *Beginner 101:* Focus on preprocessing and data exploration
- *Intermediate 201:* The balance between preprocessing, modelling and evaluation
- *Advanced 301:* Focus on modelling and hyperparameter tuning 

This repository is mainly for beginners, but we will add more and more difficult projects as we go.

## Beginner 101
### Requirements
- knowledge of **syntax** *(e.g. for/while loops and if statements)*
- knowledge of **pandas** in data preprocessing *(e.g. delete/insert column, change column name, slice/filter/merge/split a table etc.)*
- knowledge of **data types** *(e.g. object/string/int/float)*

### Projects
-  [**tlm_project1**](https://github.com/the-learning-machine/projects/tree/master/tlm_project1) - build a model that predicts a car price
- [**tlm_project2**](https://github.com/the-learning-machine/projects/tree/master/tlm_project2) - build a model that predicts (a probability of) a heart disease of a patient
