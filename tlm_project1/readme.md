## TLM PROJECT | Car Price Prediction - 09/2019

Level of difficulty: 1/10

Use datasets (automobile_data1.csv, automobile_data2.csv, automobile_data3.csv) and work in jupyter notebook (tlm_project_1.ipynb)

www.thelearningmachine.ai

In this project, you will build a model that **predicts a car price based on a certain independent variables**.

*The project contains 6 sections in total, each with step-by-step instructions of what to do. Note that, as we go further with our lessons, we will try to step away from guided projects like this to "less-guided", with less intructions involved. Thus, my advice is try to understand why we do what we do in what order.*

The six sections are as follows:
- Import the Libratries
- Import the datasets
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Overview
- Model Building
- Conculsion
